        <h1>To my favourite person,</h1>
        <p>
            Hi there baby, yes im doing another one. Where do i really start tbh. Its the second birthday i'm with you and knowing you as the person you are today I can say ive been missing out cause damn. What more can I really ask for in a girl. Youre literally everything to me and the best ive ever had at it all. My lover,bestfriend,confidant,partner I could go on and on and on.What Im really trying to say it Im proud of the person you are today. Every day seeing you grow is genuinely a blessing to experience and todays the day you get to celebrate that.I really love you so so so much you dont even know and Im so deadass. I really love you like alot.And I hope you have the best day today. You deserve it and alot more. Hopefully we still get to experience this moment many more years to come cause im not really looking for anything when i have the world with you. Ever since you stepped into my life its always been a blessing. I didnt know we could ever come to where we are today. And even as you turn 19 today, dont forget im still olderðŸ˜˜. but fr though Happy birthday my beautiful sweet princess. I know its not necessarily been the highest of highs but I want today to be about you from morning to evening. youve always been more than enough and the biggest reason I want to be a better person is all for you , hell i even look to you for a lot of things nowadays. I need you everyday of my life and as much as itakupea kiburi idc ill let you know. Ive tried making you flowers, I know its not exactly a bouquet but I hope you like them. Ill get you better ones .
